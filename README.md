# Poker
A poker hand can be tore in a two-dimenentional array where the first subscript ranges over the fours suits and the second subscript ranges over the thirteen ranks (Ace = 0). A poker hand is specified by placing 1's in the elements corresponding to the cards in the hand.

Write a program that requests the five cards as input fromt the user, creates the related array to procedures to determine the type of the hand: flush (all cards have the same suit), straight(cards have consecutive ranks - ace can come either before 2 or after King), straight flush, four-of-a-kind, full house (3 cards of one rank, two cards of another rank), three-of-a-kind, two pair, one pair, none of the above.

Ranks should be collected as Ace =1, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13

Suits should be collected as Diamonds = D, Hearts = H, Clubs = C, Spades = S
